make word immediate?

the word IMMEDIATE makes a word “immediate.” It is used in the form:

: name definition ; IMMEDIATE

that is, it is executed right after the compilation of the definition.

To give an immediate example, let’s define

: SAY-HELLO   ." Hello" ; IMMEDIATE 

We can execute SAY-HELLO interactively, just as we could if it were not immediate.

SAY-HELLO↵ Hello ok 

But if we put SAY-HELLO inside another definition, it will execute at compile time:

: GREET   SAY-HELLO ." I speak Forth " ;↵ Hello ok  

rather than at execution time:

GREET↵ I speak Forth ok 


make words objects, set immediate flag
